…if people were encouraged to build a table with their own hands…they would be able tounderstand the thinking behind it.By the word autoprogettazione Mari means an exercise to be carried out individually to improve one’s personal understanding of the sincerity behind the project. To make this possible you are guided through an archetypal and very simple technique. Therefore the end product, although usable, is only important because of its educational value.

Both Enzo Mari and Ken Isaac saw their work as informative, capable of expressing systems in which the user is surrounded by, specifically the capitalist agenda of the cold-war era. By disseminating the instructions for constructing their designs they had hoped that by allowing users would become empowered and able to acknowledge design thinking and intent. The concern of both of these designers with the role of education in the built environment makes their work the perfect foundation for our design of systems for alternative learning environments. We aim to design with simplicity, utility, and durability as the main goals of our system. Our system will be made of solid easily available materials and connectors. These furniture pieces will act together to inform the user of the systems in which they are a part of (political and economical) by inserting them directly into another (structural) system. This idea aligns with Ken Isaacs’s methods to allow for students to become “agents of synthesis by learning through praxis rather than passive digestion.” Once the form of the furniture system has been designed and realized we will create an instruction manual that will be freely available through digital methods. This manual will discuss the construction as well as the intentions of the system, becoming another platform for dissemination and education that mirrors that of Mari and Isaacs.Finally we will invite the public to participate in a workshop utilizing our furniture prototypes to materialize the ideas of systems theory. In this workshop we will challenge the participants’ interactions with space, imagery, materials and environments to understand the process in which to position themselves and their ideas in a complex interconnected world. The workshop will contain a short talk and a group discussion followed by dispersion into smaller units to explore and develop specific utilizations of the furniture centered around these ideas. The result of the systems examination workshop will be on public display at Van Eyck.____________________in-labs__________________________
We encounter “systems” in all aspects of life, from environmental systems and capital systems to social systems; they are everywhere. During this in-lab we will examine systems theory as it relates directly to the individual through both cognitive and physical experiences. Through a series of three discussion/reading/lecture groups focusing on political, educational, and structural systems, respectively we will examine how systems can result in radical changes in our built environments that then effect our cognitive sensibilities (or vice versa).
